These are some experiments in Rust for my own learning of the language, and learning about algorithms and computer science in general. I have heard a lot of people talk about "building in public", and this is my version, Learning In Public.

I am one of those people who learned about scripting languages and operating systems because I thought it was interesting, and then escalated things by learning some real Python programming because I needed to solve automation problems. A few years later, I was building data pipelines and web applications in the SaaS industry, and didn't quite know what had happened.

Along the way I convinced myself I "wasn't good at math anymore" and became someone who avoids it at all costs. Something inspired me the other day to go back to some of these fundamentals that I may have skipped in the pursuit of getting the job done. In an age when the educational materials and personalized tutoring are free, it's a shame to assume that I can't have fun learning and re-learning them.

So! If you are here, welcome. If you would like to watch me struggle and experiment with algorithms in Rust, please take a look at the git history.

COMING SOON: vibe coded git history explorer! oooooh
